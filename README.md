# N_1-MUX
N-to-1 Multiplexer (Mux)
This repository contains the Verilog implementation of an N-to-1 Multiplexer, a fundamental digital logic circuit that selects one of the N input signals and forwards it to a single output line based on a select signal.

Overview
A Multiplexer (Mux) is a combinational circuit used to route one of several input signals to an output signal based on the binary value of select lines. The N-to-1 Mux accepts N inputs and uses log2(N) select lines to determine which input is passed to the output.

For example:

In a 4-to-1 Mux, 4 input lines and 2 select lines are used.
In an 8-to-1 Mux, 8 input lines and 3 select lines are used.
